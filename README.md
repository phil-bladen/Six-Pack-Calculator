What did I understand before starting this project?
* Understanding of basic data structures (LinkedLists, queues/dequeues, stacks, BSTs) and their implementation
* Novice grasp of Java

What did I learn after completing this project?
* How Java is used to program dynamic Android Activities
* Basic familiarity with the relationship

What's coming in the next update?
* JUnit testing
* Make the app more visually appealing by separating the four user inputs across multiple pages

Future additions:
* The ability to track progress toward a sixpack overtime (display "ahead/behind schedule by ___ pounds", show the user graphs)
* Username/Password functionality for users store their data over time
* Allowing users to see the progress of other users and start "sixpack races" with their friends
* iOS support
