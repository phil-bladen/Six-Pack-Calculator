# SixPackSinglePageCalculator2

I've never written a ReadMe before, so my apolgies if this doesn't follow a traditional ReadMe convention.

My name is Phillip Bladen. Eight months ago I didn't know a single line of code, and now I'm a second-year CS student with an Android app on my resume. I'll be the first one to admit that this app doesn't look pretty or cure cancer, but every great developer was once where I stand today.

What did I understand before starting this project?
-Understanding of basic data structures (LinkedLists, queues/dequeues, stacks, BSTs) and their implementation
-Novice grasp of Java

What did I learn after completing this project?
-How Java is used to program dynamic Android Activities
-Basic familiarity with the relationship

What's coming in the next update?
-JUnit testing
-Make the app more visually appealing by separating the four user inputs across multiple pages

Future additions:
-The ability to track progress toward a sixpack overtime (display "ahead/behind schedule by ___ pounds", show the user graphs)
-Username/Password functionality for users store their data over time
-Allowing users to see the progress of other users and start "sixpack races" with their friends
-iOS support
